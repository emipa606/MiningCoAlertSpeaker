[h1]MiningCo.: Alert speaker[/h1]

Dear customers, some of you recently reported a bounce of pirate activity in the rim sector. Mining Co. is always trying to get its customers happy and "A dead customer is a bad customer!".
With our new alarm system, the alert speaker, you will never get caught sleeping in your bed during a pirate raid! (a light system is also provided for deaf people).

[h2]Features[/h2]
The alert speaker device as its name indicates will warn you of a threat. According to the current level of danger, the alert speaker will emit a light and a siren sound:
[list]
[*]No danger: no light, no sound
[*]Low danger: yellow light, 2 loud sirens
[*]High danger: red turning light, 4 alert sirens
[/list]
Colonists passing nearby will receive a small bonus to consciousness.
