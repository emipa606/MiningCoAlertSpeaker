# MiningCo.: Alert speaker


Dear customers, some of you recently reported a bounce of pirate activity in the rim sector. Mining Co. is always trying to get its customers happy and "A dead customer is a bad customer!".
With our new alarm system, the alert speaker, you will never get caught sleeping in your bed during a pirate raid! (a light system is also provided for deaf people).

## Features

The alert speaker device as its name indicates will warn you of a threat. According to the current level of danger, the alert speaker will emit a light and a siren sound:


- No danger: no light, no sound
- Low danger: yellow light, 2 loud sirens
- High danger: red turning light, 4 alert sirens


Colonists passing nearby will receive a small bonus to consciousness.
